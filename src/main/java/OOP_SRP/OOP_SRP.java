package OOP_SRP;

//Created 4 classes , each class resposible for 1 operation and in main class here we extend classes and apply methods
//but still this code violate OCP , to solve this we make interface with operation , 
//each class implements it and make a composition relation in main class with inetface
public class OOP_SRP {
    //imagine that main class that contains main function
    // here we will make an object from each class and invoke operation method
}
